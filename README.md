# gatsby-todo

A todo app built with Gatsby that allows users to create lists of things they need to do and check them off

## About

Right now this will serve as a guide for me. It will later be turned into a more proper about section.

### Landing Page

The landing page will tell users how to utilize the app. It may have a picture to show users what it looks like. Will also have a sign up CTA and a contact section. Check out the todoist. Try to implement as much of that as possible. Maybe something I can do is the hiring thing, but it leads to a page that goes like JK I'm actually looking for a job. Contact me on this if you're interested in working with me!

### User page

Make it similar to todoist. SO it's really simple on their page. When you click the add todo item it shows a popup. Then sends you back to the user page where it shows your things you need to do. Then you can click a circle next to it and it crosses off the item. It also let's you choose a date from a calander and add things to do then. Don't know how to do that, so maybe not?
