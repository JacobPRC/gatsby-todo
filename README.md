# Todo Champion

A todo app built with Gatsby that allows users to create lists of things they need to do and check them off

## About

A tongue in cheek clone of Todoist, which allows users to sign up and create todos

### Motivation

I built this app to better understand the development flow of a proper Gatsby based JAMstack app. Instead of doing a standard todo app, I wanted to create 
something that would look nice and have more functionality. I took the idea and had a lot of fun with it. There are lots of hidden jokes and refereces to Todoist. 


## Built With

React
Gatsby
Netflify -- used as CMS as well as to host AWS lambda functions and their Identity authentication
FaunaDB
@Apollo/client -- used to retrieve and manipulate data from Faunadb with graphql queries
